# Web API Deployment Challenge

Guided project for **Web API IV** module.

In this project we will learn how to deploy a Web API to `heroku`.

## Prerequisites

- Sign up for a [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) free account.

## Instructions

Please fork this repository and follow along **using your fork** as the instructor deploys the API to `heroku`.

## DEployment

- make the PORT for the api dynamic. Read the port from the enviroment.
- provide "start" script in 'package.json' that uses 'node' to run the API. Heroku will run your application using 'npm start'.
